The Technology Advisory Group (TAG) met for the first time today. This group has a role of helping us make good decisions about the technology we use and the best way to get Voluntari.ly implemented as a successful open source platform.

Currently its a small self selected group - basically some people we know who had the time to get together and give some advice. We can make this more formal as the contributing developer network expands.

We looked at the how the screen designs are starting to come together and then talked about the basic architectural requirements and what type of software stack would best support both the needs of the architecture and application but also the constraints of running an open source project with developers from all over and events like hackathons and weekends of code.

We concluded that MERN stack would be the most appropriate starting point to get us to MVP.

The components of the MERN stack are as follows:

* MongoDB, a NoSQL database
* Express.js, a web application framework that runs on Node.js
* React.js, JavaScript Front End component framework that run in browser JavaScript engines
* Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications

If you are new to any of these terms there are some more details on the wiki:

So if you want to get warmed up for coding the platform you now know where to start.

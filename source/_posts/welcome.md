![Kia ora](/vly_devnet/img/andrew-voluntarily-tiny.jpeg) My name is Andrew Watkins and I am the Product Lead for the Voluntari.ly project. Our goal is to build a great plaform that links corporate and independent volunteers with schools to give students in New Zealand great opportunities to become digitally literate and learn great tech skills.

To do that we support volunteers with everything they need to be School ready, not just with preparation and training but with access to great content: that is projects, equipment and everything else needed to be age appropriate, real world relevant, engaging and interesting.

We want the volunteers, teachers and students all to get the best out of the experience.

To build the platform we need your help. We want your tech skills, your volunteer time and your knowledge of content and teaching to help make the voluntari.ly platform truly relevant and successful.

If you are interested in becoming a contributor please get in touch at <a href="mailto:kiaora@volutari.ly">kiaora@volutari.ly</a>


Thanks Andrew

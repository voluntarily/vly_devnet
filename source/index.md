 Our goal is to build a great plaform that links corporate and independent volunteers with schools to give students in New Zealand great opportunities to become digitally literate and learn great tech skills.

To do that we support volunteers with everything they need to be *School Ready*, not just with preparation and training but with access to great content: that is projects, equipment and everything else needed to be age appropriate, real world relevant, engaging and interesting.

We want the volunteers, teachers and students all to get the best out of the experience.

To build the platform we need your help. We want your tech skills, your volunteer time and your knowledge of content and teaching to help make the voluntari.ly platform truly relevant and successful.


# Get started as a contributor to Voluntari.ly

Help us build a platform that connects corporate volunteer time with classrooms to teach science, technology, engineering, entrepreneurship, arts and design with the help of engaging content supplied by New Zealandâ€™s leading innovators in educational content.

To do that we support volunteers with everything they need to be School ready, not just with preparation and training but with access to great content: that is projects, equipment and everything else needed to be age appropriate, real world relevant, engaging and interesting.

Voluntari.ly is based in Auckland, New Zealand and while we want to build a global support community it will be easiest to participate in our regular hackathons and code sprints if you are nearby.

This is an open source project all code and documentation is freely available.

# Team Organisation
### Ring 0 - Core Product team

Employed by Voluntari.ly
* Andrew - Product lead
* Walter - Design lead
* Open - Engineering lead

### Ring 1 - Foundation Engineers & technical advisory group

Key engineers (developers, BA, architects, QA, devops) who are helping to establish the product as an effective open source platform.

This group will help us setup the project, decide on the software stack and tools, act as the technical advisory group and help with integration and developing feature stories.  You'll also help mentor the contributing engineers and lead groups in the code sprints.

Anyone can join this group but we are looking for some industry experience and being prepared to commit some sustained time the the project over the first year. Ideally the company that you work for can also support donating some of your time to the project.

### Ring 2 - Contributing Engineers
If you don't have the time, or don't feel you have the experience to join the foundation engineers then you can still support the project.
* Attend a Hackathon
* Join a code sprint
* fix bugs
* write tests
* even just try out the system and feed back observations and ideas.

### Ring 3 - Volunteers
Once Voluntari.ly is up and running we will post opportunities to help develop the platform there. You can simply sign up as a volunteer and offer your help for a specific opportunity.
